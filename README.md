## 🔍 Overview

Self-consistency in prompt engineering is a method that generates multiple responses to a single prompt and combines them to create a more accurate output. This technique mitigates errors and inconsistencies inherent in LLM outputs.

## 🗝️ Key Concepts

- **Multiple Response Generation**: Creating varied outputs for a single prompt
- **Response Analysis**: Comparing and examining the generated responses
- **Aggregation**: Combining results to produce a final, more accurate answer

## 💻 Implementation

Our implementation follows these steps:

1. Create a specific and clear prompt
2. Generate multiple responses
3. Compare and examine the responses
4. Aggregate the results

Check out our [code examples](./examples) to see it in action!

## 🚀 Benefits

- Increased accuracy
- Reduced impact of outliers
- Better handling of ambiguous tasks
- Confidence measurement

## 🔬 Advanced Techniques

We also explore more sophisticated approaches:

- Weighted Aggregation
- Clustering
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting

## ⚠️ Challenges

While powerful, self-consistency has its limitations:

- Computational cost
- Time complexity
- Potential for consensus bias
